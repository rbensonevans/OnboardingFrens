OnboardingFrens allows users who are having trouble with web3 technologies to contact a support specialist to receive real-time help.

Frens seeking help login in using **Web3Auth** or **WalletConnect**. Once they are connected, they input their issues on the help page. Using **PUSH** notifications, the agents are notified when a fren has a problem with a protocol that they are a verified expert in. **PUSH** notifications notify both the agent and fren when the chat is ready for them to enter. The chat transcript is recorded and metadata is sent to **IPFS** data warehouse at the end of the chat. The chat ends once the fren ends the chat, and then they are immediately shown a feedback form to ensure their problem was solved. When **PUSH** chat capabilities are live, the chat will move from a standard web2 chat box to on-chain chatting.

By rating the customer experience, the fren adds to the agent's reputation, which is shown on a leaderboard to incentivize great customer service.

The agent also connects their wallet through **Web3Auth** (which includes **WalletConnect** capabilities). The agent is a confirmed party that earns as they provide support services. After an agent connects their wallet, they click the "clock in" button next to their profile which signals that they are available to provide support. Clicking "clock in" creates a blockchain transaction that is timestamped, after which point the agent begins accruing time which will be paid out through **Superfluid**. Once the agent logs in, they will be notified through **PUSH** when frens need help.

At any time during a shift, the agent can check the funds they are accruing by clicking the "cash flow" button. At the end of the shift, the agent clicks "clock out" triggering a smart contract execution, and receives their funds from the OnboardingFrens wallet through **Superfluid**.
